Installer by Jboy included (but i have change it little to fit the BTI Tracker 1.4.X, PB Edition 1.5.X). 
First i will thanks all users
on the Btiteams forum and all developer
on Btiteam, who have provided BTI Tracker 1.4.X, PB Edition 1.5.X
with the lovley hacks and the lovley Bti tracker Source.
Don't Remove the Copyright info in the footer,
think of that, btit is a open source and same with this
full modded Edition. By having that copyright in footer
you are supporting the prodject btit and now this release so
we can keep it as a open source and having
the prodject's alive and keep it free.
Why im not writing all Credits to the users who have
made the hacks i might have included in this release,
is that i can't remember all nicks, but if u "the creator" want to have
your credits in the file just send me a PM on btiteam.org.

that everything shall be okey.

designers on your tracker.

Some handy things to know:

If u want only owners to have

if u want admin to access things
(admin and owner can see this).
Use ["admin_access"] and
mod access is ["mod_access"].

If u want to custom your blocks
you can use an array and justify in block_begin
i have rewrited the function for
block_begin. You can use the function like
this:
block_begin("Disclaimer",'1','justify',
array('width'=>'500px','font'=>'10px Verdana,Tahoma', 'padding'=>'1px'));

Allso torrents

the rest of the word get
